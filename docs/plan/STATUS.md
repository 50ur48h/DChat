## Phase 0 — Bootstrap & walking skeleton (M0)
- [x] WP0.1 Repo, docs, tracking files, branch protection
- [x] WP0.2 API skeleton (FastAPI, /healthz, tooling, Dockerfile)
- [x] WP0.3 Web skeleton (Next.js, health page, tooling, Dockerfile)
- [x] WP0.4 Compose stack + Makefile + pizza seed v0

      must stop drifting before evals are written against it

## Phase 10 — Knowledge + semantic layer (M10)
- [ ] WP10.1 Docs ingest/chunk/embed/retrieve under RLS + APIs
- [ ] WP10.2 Semantic definitions + verified queries + critic enforcement ← gate
- [ ] GATE: uploaded policy changes generated SQL; isolation test; sign-off

## Notes

- **UI follows docs/design.md.** Tokens live in `apps/web/src/app/globals.css`;
  primitives in `src/components/ui/`. A raw hex value anywhere else is a bug,
  and adding a component library needs a DECISIONS entry first.

- **Every new tenant table, in every later phase, must be added to
  `TENANT_TABLES` and given an RLS policy in the same PR.** This is not left
  to memory: `test_no_tenant_table_can_be_added_without_protecting_it` asks
  the database which tables carry `org_id` and fails on any that are
  undeclared or unprotected.

- **WP0.1** shipped as the single allowed direct push to `main` (plan §6, Phase 0).
  Its checkbox was flipped to `[x]` in the first follow-up PR (WP0.2), because a WP
  is only marked done through a PR (plan §1.3).
- **WP0.2 and WP0.3 were built in parallel** off `main` and merged as #1 and #2;
  the second was rebased onto the first, unioning the root `Makefile`.
- **WP0.4** ships the local stack; **WP0.5** ships CI. The Phase 0 GATE is the
  only thing left in this phase and it is yours: run `make up && make seed`,
  open http://localhost:3000, confirm the page reports the API healthy, then
  sign off and the gate checkbox flips in the first Phase 1 PR.
- Branch protection now requires `hygiene`, `api` and `web` — the D-003
  follow-through, applied once those jobs existed.
